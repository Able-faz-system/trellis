// Panic safety (#154): a panic in a Soroban contract traps the host — the
// transaction reverts but the caller is still charged the fee, and an
// unexpected trap can leave callers reasoning about inconsistent state. Every
// entrypoint below is therefore panic-free by construction:
//
//   * milestone lookups go through `storage::read_milestone`, which maps a
//     missing/out-of-range index to `TrellisError::InvalidMilestone` via
//     `Option::ok_or` — never `Vec::get(id).unwrap()` or index syntax;
//   * agreement reads go through `storage::read_header` / `read_agreement`,
//     which map a missing entry to `TrellisError::AgreementNotFound` via
//     `Option::ok_or`;
//   * every fallible entrypoint returns `Result<_, TrellisError>` so failures
//     propagate as typed on-chain errors, not panics.
//
// There are no `unwrap()` / `expect()` calls anywhere in the contract crate's
// non-test sources. The `token::Client` transfer calls can still trap inside
// the SDK (e.g. the payer does not hold enough balance) — that is the token
// contract's own boundary and is intentionally left to it. A custom
// `#[panic_handler]` is not added: `soroban-sdk` already provides one for the
// wasm build and a second definition is a duplicate-lang-item error.
// `test_panic_boundaries.rs` fuzzes these paths to keep the property enforced.
