/// Canonical error type for the Trellis Protocol contract.
///
/// `#[contracterror]` serialises each variant's `u32` discriminant into the
/// XDR `ScError` envelope returned to the invoker, making error codes part of the
/// public on-chain ABI.
///
/// # Stability rule
/// Discriminant values are **permanent** from the first mainnet deployment
/// onwards: never renumber an existing variant, only append new ones at the
/// end.  While the protocol is pre-release (no mainnet deployment yet) the
/// numbering is still being compacted — variant `6` (`NotDisputeResolver`)
/// was removed because no codepath could ever return it, and `NoFundsToRefund`
/// was renumbered from `7` to `6` to close the gap. `NoFundsToRefund` (then
/// discriminant `6`) was itself later removed for the same reason: no
/// codepath ever returned it. Discriminant `6` is left vacant rather than
/// reused, per the append-only rule above. SDT consumers pinned to the old
/// numbering must regenerate their bindings.
///
/// # Exhaustiveness
/// `#[non_exhaustive]` is what makes the append-only rule above enforceable by
/// the compiler rather than by convention. Without it, any downstream `match`
/// over `TrellisError` that enumerates the current variants is accepted today
/// and becomes a hard compile error the next time a variant is appended —
/// turning a documented stability guarantee into a breaking change for
/// consumers. With it, downstream matches are required to carry a wildcard arm
/// from the start, so appending a variant stays non-breaking.
///
/// This is the same treatment [`crate::types::EscrowStatus`] already has, and
/// for the same reason: both are append-only enums in the public ABI. No `match`
/// inside this crate is exhaustive over `TrellisError` (every site either
/// constructs an error or compares against one), so the attribute costs
/// nothing here.
